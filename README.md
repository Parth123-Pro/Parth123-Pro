Wooing Master's in AI & Data Science at DIT, building on a Bachelor's in Computer Science. At the intersection of technology and creativity, I develop blockchain applications and predictive analytics tools, focusing on user-centric solutions.

As a full-stack developer and co-owner of Codizious Technologies, I have extensive experience in web, mobile, blockchain, and AI applications. My work on a decentralized financial app showcases my proficiency in emerging tech trends. Beyond coding, I enjoy painting and culinary exploration.

I also started my own successful startup called "Boba Mona", which has been recognized by many foundations.

### Professional Experience
-At Codizious Technologies, I developed dynamic web applications using JavaScript and TypeScript, built responsive UIs with React.js, and implemented server-side applications and APIs using Node.js, Express.js, and GraphQL. A key project was an e-commerce platform.

-In mobile development, I created cross-platform applications with React Native, including a fitness tracking app with GPS tracking, workout logs, and social sharing.

-After completing an online course in blockchain development, I freelanced, developing smart contracts on Ethereum using Solidity and integrating blockchain functionality into web apps with Web3.js. Notable projects include Blockchain-CointMint-Truffle-SC, EthereumBlockchain, Mining-Crypto, and MetaverseRKU.

-In AI and data science, I utilized Python for data analysis and machine learning, built models with TensorFlow, performed data manipulation with Pandas, and implemented algorithms with Scikit-Learn. Highlights include developing a stock price prediction model and YOLOv8-ObjectD, an object detection project using YOLOv8.

### Author
Soon to be the author of my own book, "________________", I also helped my friend Manav Dave write his first book, "Celestial Whispers", which is currently available on Amazon.

### Courses
AI & Data Science, Blockchain Specialization, Flutter & UI/UX Development, Android Development, JS and so on....
